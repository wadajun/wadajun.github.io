Hello, my name is Anthony Wada, and as of Spring 2020, I am an MIS major. When I first got admitted to the University of Hawaii at Manoa in 2016, I was initially an ICS major. In my second year, I decided to study abroad at Kyoto University in Japan. During my stay in Japan, I have learned many things related to IT and experienced what it was like to work in an IT venture company for an internship. However, I realized that programming was something I did not want pursue as a career, so I took a gap year after coming home in Spring 2018. During my gap year, I tried to figure out what I wanted to do in the future but realized that I still have passion in the IT field. After looking up all the possible options I could pick, I started to become interested in becoming an IT manager. In Fall 2019, I decided to return to school and decided to change my major to MIS because of my passion for working in the IT field and having an interest in the business world. Hoping that I made the right choice, I will also hope to have an amazing experience working towards my degree.
