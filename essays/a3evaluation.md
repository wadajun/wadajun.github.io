**1. What was accomplished in the project as compared to what was planned?**

Originally, I had thought nothing would've worked on this Assignment. However, in the end things still worked since I made some changes from my previous Assignment (i.e. function.js).

**2. Any notable shortcomings, bugs, problems, or additional features not implemented?**

I think I could've styled my shop layout, rather than using the basics which I have used for my Smartphone Products. I should've taken more time to complete my Assignments. 

**3. What was your biggest project risk and how was it managed?**

The biggest project risk for me is working on sending an email. At first, I was going start from scratch to work on the codes to send an email for my invoice. However, I should've checked the Assignment 3 Example codes provided by Professor Port and I noticed that there was an example for how to send an email. After finding that code, things felt much easier for sending an email to users after a purchase has been made. 

**4. What is your assessment of the overall quality of the system?**

Overall I feel like my Assignment is not up to par and does not meet the requirements that was asked for. Unfortunately, I have not used enough time to work on the Assignment. 

**5. What is needed before this system can be placed into operation?**

The main thing I feel like should be improved is my appearance of shop. If I made my shop looked much nicer and used the stylesheet more, I feel like the looks of my shop would've been nicer. 

**6. Describe what you are most proud of about this project:**

In this project, the most I am proud of was to even get the codes to actually work. Even though I only know a little bit of coding, I was just simply proud that I was able to code something to become a website for shopping. 
 
**7. Describe what you are least happy with this project:**

The one biggest thing I am least happy with this project is how everything had ended up at the end, and I felt like I could have done a lot more to make improvements to my Assignment 1, 2, and 3.
