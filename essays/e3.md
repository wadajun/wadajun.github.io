I have created a sales receipt that had five different items. I included a price and quantity per item. By combining these two, I made an expression and variable to compute my subtotal and grand total. For Invoice1, I took 18 min, which is within the Rx time. To achieve an Rx time, I often like to practice on my own first by creating a test file, and once I think it looks good, I would usually start recording. However, I believe this WOD felt more challenging than the BrowserHistory WODs I have worked on recently. The most challenging part of this WOD was creating a table. When working on my test file, I started watching the example screencast to see how it was done and noticed how copying the table from the page source would make it work. After figuring that out, I went ahead and tried to do the same thing. After I got that out of the way, everything felt much easier since going through the readings is a great source to use when you want to understand what to do and how to execute specific things. When preparing for this WOD, I did the same thing as I did with my previous WODs. I like to create a test file first and start working on the project first before recording my screencast. If I do this, I can explain each of my steps well since I understand what  I am doing. However, during my WOD, I have made a mistake towards the end of my screencast by misspelling my <script> tag. For future WODs, to reduce these kinds of errors, it is best to take your time and try not to rush through it, so you do not make any careless errors.
