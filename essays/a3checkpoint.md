**Show what each page will look like. The pages do not have to be “functional” but the design should clear.**

The design of my Assignment 3 will have my four different types of products (Soprano, Alto, Tenor, and Baritone) and when you click those links, you will be sent to a page where it shows the products for those types. When you access those pages, you will be able to enter how many products you want which should be linked to the invoice page. Other than that, I believe that most of my page will look the same from Assignment 2. Another feature I will try to add on Assignment 3 will be a button where user's can logout on their own by clicking on a hyperlink.

**Describe your design for your site’s shopping cart. That is, will it be a separate page that the user can view and edit, or will it be integrated into the product pages? If so, describe in detail how this will work on your site. Provide several examples of using the cart.**

I am thinking of adding a feature will it will show how many products are currently in the user's shopping cart, and this should be updated each time a user confirms the amount of products they desire. The number and shopping cart will be located in the navigation bar that I will be setting up.

**Explain specifically how you will use sessions to manage your shopping cart. In particular, what shopping cart data will be stored in the session, what data format will be used (NOT what data type, but the format like with the data format used for your registration data). Use code examples showing what data structures (such as arrays and their objects) you will use to manage the shopping cart data and how they will be used in a session.**

My codes will be based off of the example Professor Port has provided us in <a href="https://dport96.github.io/ITM352/morea/180.Assignment3/reading-code-examples.html">Assignment 3 Code Examples</a> to manage my shopping cart. In this code, I plan to create a session where I am able to store the data that comes from my product page and will be sent to my shopping cart page as a JSON. 

**How will you avoid access to your application when the user has not logged in or registered? What are the particular security concerns you must address?**

If the user is not logged in or register, I will try to implement something where the user is unable to access their shopping cart. If the user is not logged in and clicks their shopping cart, I will redirect them to the login page. However, if the user is not register, they will need to click on the register link on the login page so they can create an account to finalize their shopping. A security concern I should probably address is, again, in order for the user to be unable to access their shopping cart, I will make sure to have the user login or register an account so they can also edit their shopping cart, if necessary.

**Upon a successful login, how do you provide personalization in your UI? Explain how you did or will do this (paste code if necessary)**

Upon a successful login, I will try to have a pop up message show up which should be an alert, that might congratulate them for successfully logging in. I have not decided what exactly the message will be at this time. Since one of the requirement for this assignment is to send an email to users about their transactions, and an transaction cannot be done without logging in with an account, I will be sending the email to the user. 

**If you are working with partners, how will you split up the work in your team so that you are working in parallel as effectively as possible? That is, who is doing what and when?**

I will not be working with a partner. 

**How are you approaching Assignment 3 differently than Assignment 2?**

For Assignment 3, I will be starting earlier than I have compared to both Assignment 1 and 2, and I will definitely be asking Professor Port for help when necessary, which I think I really needed sometimes when I was trying complete the previous Assignments.
